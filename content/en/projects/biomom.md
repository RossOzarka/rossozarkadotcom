**B10M0M** is my upcoming animated feature film. I'm animating the entire thing myself, and I made this scene as a style exploration.

This is the most detailed, complicated rendering of my papercraft animation style that I've ever achieved, however it took me about 6 months to make this one scene, so I'm currently exploring alternative methods of rendering the visuals.

I have the entire film made in animatic form, if you'd like to see it, email me at ross.ozarka@gmail.com!
