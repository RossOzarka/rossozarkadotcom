at Kea Kids News, I write and perform a rap song for each of my co-workers on their birthdays. We thought it would be funny if my explainer video on the history of the Takahe, the New Zealand bird that came back from extinction, was told in a rap song. Amazingly, our production co-ordinator Amber Smith found a kid who had performed *Lose Yourself* by Eminem at his school's talent show, and he performed the rap for us.

I wrote the rap, animated, and edited this music video.
