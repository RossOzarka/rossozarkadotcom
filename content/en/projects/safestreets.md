**Safe Streets, No Crime**, was our entry into the 2024 48 Hour Film Festival in New Zealand. The script was written by myself, Alice Gatland, Aaron Burr, and Hadassah Green. I painted the characters, animated, and edited the film. Aaron wrote the score, and Hadassah sang that amazing opening song.

This made it into the Auckland Finals, so it played to an audience of a couple hundred people. It was amazing to hear the audience go from perplexed to roaring with laughter over the course of the short!

Since it's a  48 Hour Film, it has its flaws. but to me, **Safe Streets, No Crime** is my masterpiece.
