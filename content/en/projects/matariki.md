This is a pilot for a 9-episode animated series based on Maori mythology, which unfortunately never got picked up. The appearance of the Matariki (Pleiades) constellation on the horizon marks the beginning of the Maori calendar, with each star of Matariki representing a different god or goddess, governing a different domain of life. So in each episode of the show, the characters would encounter another of the nine stars and once again find themselves in over their heads in comic mischief!

The script was written by Popai Tukiwaho, who was 12 years old at the time. He had already written and performed his own play before writing this project. Such talent! He also directed the voice actors. It was an honour to bring his imagination to life.

My contribution was editing the audio takes into the finished script, creating the animation, and cutting it all together. I also composed the score!
