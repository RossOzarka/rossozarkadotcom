Hi! I'm Ross Ozarka, an award-winning animator based in Auckland. I specialize in papercraft animation and VFX compositing.
For the last seven years, I've had my own animated segment on New Zealand's top children's program.
I've also made award-winning shorts, feature films, web series. I love telling character-driven stories with surprising twists and turns!
I'd love to show off my skills and work with you!
